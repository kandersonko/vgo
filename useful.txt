%initial-action f code g [Directive]
Declare that the braced code must be invoked before parsing each time yyparse is
called. The code may use $$ (or $<tag>$) and @$ — initial value and location of the
lookahead — and the %parse-param.
For instance, if your locations use a file name, you may use
%parse-param { char const *file_name };
%initial-action
{
@$.initialize (file_name);
};
